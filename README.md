# Time Series Forecasting Toolkit
A unified repository for end-to-end time series analysis and forecasting. Explore data preparation, model development, evaluation, and visualization workflows‚Äîranging from classical statistical approaches to modern machine-learning methods.

# üîç Overview

## Data Preparation
- Organize raw and cleaned datasets
- Support for flexible resampling (daily, weekly, monthly)

## Exploratory Analysis
- Visualization of trends, seasonality, and residual patterns
- Stationarity checks and autocorrelation diagnostics

## Modeling

- Machine-Learning Forecasting: Tree-based, neural network, and hybrid pipelines
- Modular scripts for training, hyperparameter tuning, and batch evaluation
- Evaluation & Comparison
- Rolling-window backtesting
- Standard accuracy metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE, MAPE)
- Side-by-side performance reports
- Visualization & Export
- Publication-quality plots of historical vs. predicted values
- Export forecasts and diagnostics for downstream use
